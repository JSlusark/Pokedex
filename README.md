This is a simple Pokedex app created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to explore a list of Pokemon fetched from the PokeAPI. When the user clicks on a Pokemon name, they can view the details of that particular Pokemon. The app also features a custom-designed Pokedex interface with screens and clickable buttons.
